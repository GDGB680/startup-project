# Bounty Hunter

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is a site for people to put in rfps to find the music they are looking for and collaborate with otherwise unknown content creators. Ex: "I need some original music for my youtube video". go to the site and request what you want. there will then be a sub competition to fulfil the request.




> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

There are many music libraries and sites out there to find music for your video or commercial or whatever, but what if you could get a song tailor made to what you want? even better what if you could get many such songs and choose the best one? That is what Bounty hunter aims to do with the way it is.

### Key features

* Request & Contest Features

  * Submission Gallery: Creators view and compare all contest entries, with options to preview, filter, and sort submissions.

* Collaboration & Engagement
  * Messaging & Feedback: Built-in chat or comment tools allow real-time discussion, feedback, and iteration between requester and musicians.
  * Contest Voting/Judging: Requesters (and optionally the community) can vote or rate submissions, increasing engagement and encouraging creators.
  * Profile Pages: Every user‚Äîrequester or musician‚Äîhas a profile with contest history, wins, and sample works.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Five HTML pages. Request songs page, search for bounties page, login page, contest page, profile page. Hyperlinks to choice artifact.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Implement the login system and input forms using React components (e.g., user authentication, contest entry, song request forms). Display dynamic choices such as contest submissions, selectable winner, and bounty filters with React state management.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  * Create a new song request (RFP)
  * List/search existing bounties
  * Submit a track to a bounty‚Äôs contest
  * View entries for a bounty
  * Handle authentication
  * Fetch user profile, recent submissions, win history

- **DB/Login** - Store users (authentication, roles), bounty requests, contest submissions, selected winners, profile info.
- **WebSocket** - Enable real-time notifications (e.g., new bounty posted, contest updates, winner announcements). Use WebSocket for live collaboration features‚Äîartists and requesters can chat, provide feedback, and track contest status as it happens.
